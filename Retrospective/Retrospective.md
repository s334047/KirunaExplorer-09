# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 09)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed 4 vs. done 3
- Total points committed 10 vs. done 6
- Nr of hours planned 40h vs. spent 70h45m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required

We respected strictly your DoD given in the slide

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| :---: | :-----: | :----: | :--------: | :----------: |
| _#0_  |    8    |   /    |     10     |      13      |

| _#4_  |    3    |   4    |     5      |    6h 30m    |

> story `#0` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average: (planned) 1h 48m (spent) 3h 14m
- Standard deviation: (planned) 1.03 (spent) 2.59
- Total estimation error ratio: 0.77

- Absolute relative task estimation error: 0.

## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Total hours estimated: 14h
  - Total hours spent: 29h 15m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 57
  - Coverage:

|   File    | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| All files |  80.35  |  71.42   |  93.15  |  80.86  |

- E2E testing

  - Total hours estimated: //
  - Total hours spent: //
    We spent some time using postman and Gui test, but we did not tracked them.

- Code review

  - Total hours estimated: //
  - Total hours spent: //

- Code refactoring
  - Total hours estimated: 1h
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

1. Generic problems with Jest (mock, server)
2. A wrong first version of the Database
3. Some time spent during merg conflicts
4. Underrated tasks
5. Lack of communication between us

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

1. Installing all the tests' dependancies is more difficult that expected
2. Planning the API docmentation before the development phase
3. Develop a better database since the beginning
4. Use common best practices that are defined togheter
5. More communication and more attention to each other

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

1. Better plan since the beginning
2. More meetings (in persons / videocall)
3. Use common best practices that are defined togheter
4. Better to have branches for each stories or tasks

  > Propose one or two

- We smile, laugh anf joke to each other!!
- We are proud of us: small team but strong one!!
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
