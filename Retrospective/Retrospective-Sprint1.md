## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  1. Some tasks were releted to others, and we didn't considere these aspect (fourth story)

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  1. The coordination with the group is crucial for the team work and also for the entire purpose of the project

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

  1. Better planning activity since the beginning
  2. We increase the number of meetings
  3. Use common best practices that are defined togheter

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

1. Better communication

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  1. Focus more precisely on the core objectives of each story without losing sight of their intended goals

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
  Even if we discuss we still laugh
